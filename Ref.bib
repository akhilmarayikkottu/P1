	annote = {We report on the completion of the first version of a new-generation simulation code, FLASH. The FLASH code solves the fully compressible, reactive hydrodynamic equations and allows for the use of adaptive mesh refinement. It also contains state-of-the-art modules for the equations of state and thermonuclear reaction networks. The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.}

abstract = "We present the piecewise parabolic method, a higher-order extension of Godunov's method. There are several new features of this method which distinguish it from other higher-order Godunov-type methods. We use a higher-order spatial interpolation than previously used, which allows for a steeper representation of discontinuities, particularly contact discontinuities. We introduce a simpler and more robust algorithm for calculating the nonlinear wave interactions used to compute fluxes. Finally, we recognize the need for additional dissipation in any higher-order Godunov method of this type, and introduce it in such a way so as not to degrade the quality of the results."

abstract = "In this work, an experimental description has been given of some physical processes occurring and induced in atmospheric pressure nitrogen by very fast spark discharges. The time range investigated spans from the very first tens of nanoseconds (spark phase) up to the submillisecond scale. Experiments were based upon the application of both the laser-schlieren technique, yielding 2-D qualitative visualization, and the 1-D quantitative Rayleigh laser-light scattering, from which the gas mass density radial distributions were derived, for delays from the spark greater than 1 μs. Following the energy deposition stage, three main time domains have been identified, corresponding respectively to i) the fast expansion of the excited gas kernel and of the resulting shock wave, (0.2–10 μs) ii) the subsequent, ordered gas flow-field, involving recirculation of fresh gases into the spark gap (10–40 μs) and, finally, iii) the transition of the coherent fluid dynamic structures toward chaotic, turbulent mixing of excited and cold gases (40–200 μs). Next, from the depolarized light scattering data in the range 5–15 μs, some indications were drawn, about the recombination process of the atomic nitrogen, which has been shown to have lifetimes of the order of tens of microseconds, thus exhibiting interesting properties as an efficient energy reservoir."

abstract = {Extending on a companion paper in this colloquium, the dispersion, ignition and combustion characteristics of aluminum particle clouds is investigated numerically behind reflected shock waves. It is observed that a higher proportion of the Al cloud by mass burns for a higher initial cloud concentration. Vorticity from the cloud wake and from that deposited by the reflected shock cause the particle cloud to convolute, and this effect is particularly very significant for higher concentration clouds. Faster ignition delay times and higher overall Al burning by mass are observed for stronger incident shock Mach numbers due to the consequent hotter gas temperatures behind the reflected shock wave. A mass-weighted ignition parameter is introduced in this study and is identified to be particularly useful to determine overall cloud ignition trends.},

@article{Dominik1997,
	abstract = {Even though dust coagulation is a very important dust-processing mechanism in interstellar space and protoplanetary disks, there are still important parts of the physics involved that are poorly understood. This imposes a serious problem for model calculations of any kind. In this paper, we attempt to improve the situation by including the effects of tangential forces on the contact in some detail. These have been studied in recent papers. We summarize the main results from these papers and apply them to detailed simulations of the coagulation process and of collisions between dust aggregates. Our results show the following: (1) the growth of aggregates by monomers will normally not involve major restructuring of the aggregates, (2) the classical hit-and-stick assumption is reasonably valid for this case, (3) collisions of aggregates with each other or with large grains can lead to significant compaction, and (4) the results can be easily understood in terms of critical energies for different restructuring processes. We also derive a short summary that may be used as a recipe for determining the outcome of collisions in coagulation calculations. It is shown that turbulent velocity fields in interstellar clouds are capable of producing considerably compressed aggregates, while the small aggregates forming early on in the solar nebula will not be compacted by collisions. However, compaction provides an important energy sink in collisions of larger aggregates in the solar nebula.},

abstract = "The erosion of dust by a shock wave in air and by the subsequent air flow was investigated theoretically and experimentally. The paths of single particles were calculated for the initial state of erosion when the flow in the shock tube boundary layer was still laminar. High-speed cinematographic experiments performed with a shock tube yielded mapping of the development of the dust cloud. From the agreement between the measured height of the cloud and the calculated height of flight of the particles one can conclude that the assumed model for the motion of the particles adequately describes the removal of particles from the wall."
